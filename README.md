This project has been developed for the Data Mining class by [t0re199](https://github.com/t0re199) and [adel3roman6](https://github.com/adel3roman6).
       
The project consists of Data Analysis, Exploration and Multi-Class Classification on a [Google Play Application Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps) in Python.   
Many data science liberaries have been used, examples are:   

* **NumPy**      
* **Pandas**      
* **SkLearn**     
* **Imblearn**   
* **Matplotlib**  
* **Seaborn**

## Classification ##

The following classifiers have beed used:
* **Decision Tree**
* **SupportVector Machines**    
* **K-Nearest Neighbour**     
* **Random Forest**
* **AdaBoost** with Decision Trees as weak learners.
